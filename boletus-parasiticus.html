  Boletus parasiticus
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  <strong><em>Boletus parasiticus</em></strong> is an unlikely edible wild mushroom.  When I first encountered one, I did not expect that I’d later be eating it.  In fact, I wasn’t quite sure what it was.  I knew it was a bolete, but what were the strange orb-like growths protruding from the base of every specimen?  My first guess was that they were “aborted” forms caused by a parasitic fungus, much like <em>Entoloma abortivum</em>, the aborted entoloma.  Upon further inspection, it became clear that the growths were actually common earthballs, <em>Scleroderma citrinum</em>.  Nothing was parasitizing the boletes—the boletes were parasitizing earthballs.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, I had even more doubt that these boletes were edible, because earthballs are well known to be poisonous.  Further research showed that <em>B. parasiticus</em> is edible as long as you don’t eat the earthballs beside them.  Many field guides list them as inedible, possibly because of their close association with the similarly-colored poisonous mushroom.  However, I can say from personal experience that they make a fine meal.  They may not be king boletes, but they have a pleasant taste and texture, and I look forward to foraging for more in the future.
</p>
<p>
  I would say they are safer to eat than most boletes because you will always find them parasitizing earthballs and will never find any other boletes playing that role.  Therefore, they are the easiest bolete for me to identify without a field guide—even from a distance.  Plus earthballs look radically different in form and especially when sliced open.
</p>
<p>
  <em>B. parasiticus</em> would make a great addition to your edible mushroom hunt.
